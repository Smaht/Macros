# Basic Setup

There are very few setup steps required to get going.  These steps are as follows.  The steps are short - please read them in full before proceeding.

### Backup your current MacroQuest2 folder

Always always ALWAYS backup your MacroQuest2 folder prior to doing any significant macro changes.  This is as simple as right-clicking your MacroQuest2 folder and choosing copy, followed by a paste.  I would suggest renaming the copied folder ('MacroQuest2 - copy') to something more useful (for example: 'MacroQuest2 - 20170115')

### Get the full package

This step is very easy.  Simply download or clone the repository and ensure the 'Macros' folder is within your MQ2 installation.  If you have an existing installation, I would suggest backing that up before this step (this can be done simply by renaming your current 'Macros' folder to something else, for example 'Macros - 20170115').  Once you have the Macros folder in the right place, load up the game on any client, and run the macro once ('/macro e3') and it will build all appropriate files.  If you have an previous MQ2 installation, be aware that during setup, this macro will create and/or update a number of your aliases.  Backing up your specific 'MacroQuest.ini' file is an excellent idea (but you've already done that - right?).

### Create Bot Ini files for each character in the "e3 Bot Inis" folder

The first time you load e3x on a new character, a default file will be created for that character within this folder.  This file while basic and capable to get you going, likely will need some work.  Sample files for each class are provided that illustrate some of the functionality.  If you have an existing e3 installation, your bot.ini files are backwards compatable with e3x.

# In game help

While in game, the command "/e3help" will provide you access to an ingame repository of documentation on various features.  Much of this is from the stock e3 build provided by Killian, though new features and functionality have been documented by me.  As always, an ongoing process
