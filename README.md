This macro for EverQuest represents an extension of the popular e3 written by Killian.  This extension (referred to as e3x) contains various fixes and additions.

### Basic Setup

There are very few setup steps required to get going.  These steps are as follows:

# Rename sample files in the "e3 Macro Inis" folder

This step is very easy.  Simply navigate to the "e3 Macro Inis" folder and rename each of the files ending in ".sample", removing the sample portion.  For example  "Advanced Settings.ini.sample" would become "Advanced Settings.ini"

# Create Bot Ini files for each character in the "e3 Bot Inis" folder

The first time you load e3x on a new character, a default file will be created for that character within this folder.  This file while basic and capable to get you going, likely will need some work.  Sample files for each class are provided that illustrate some of the functionality

### In game help

While in game, the command "/e3help" will provide you access to an ingame repository of documentation on various features.  Much of this is from the stock e3 build provided by Killian, though new features and functionality have been documented by me.  As always, an ongoing process
